We invite you to complete our EOI if you believe your organisation can also make a positive difference to the lives of people in your local community through helping them into sustainable work.

Opportunity Overview
Connect to Work is part of the Government's Get Britain Working Strategy. The programme will be commissioned locally by lead accountable bodies (e.g. Combined Authorities and Local Authorities). Connect to Work is a voluntary, high-fidelity Supported Employment programme in England and Wales, to help economically inactive people who want to work, to remove their barriers to work and find sustainable employment. Priority participants groups will be disabled people, people with health conditions and people in the specified cohorts. The specified cohorts are: Offenders or ex-offenders; carers or ex-carers; people who are homeless; a former member of the Armed Forces or partner of current/former Armed Forces personnel; a person with a drug/alcohol dependency; a care experienced young person or care leaver; a refugee, a resettled Afghan or a person on the Ukrainian scheme; a victim/survivor of domestic abuse; young persons identified as being involved/at risk of being involved in serious violence; victims of modern slavery.

It is anticipated that 75% of participants will follow the Individual Placement & Support (IPS) model and 25% will follow the Supported Employment model. It is expected that delivery partners will follow the respective fidelity assurance systems (IPS and SEQF).

We are seeking expressions of interest (EOI) from local organisations with experience of locally delivering: 
1. IPS services
2. Supported Employment services
3. Proven employability services, supporting those who are furthest from the labour market
4. Specialist services removing barriers to employment for one or more of the above specified groups
Given that the nature of these locally commissioned programmes will require local, community-based delivery, we will be looking for evidence of this in EOI responses.

Responding to this EOI
Please fully complete and submit this EOI before the closing date of Friday 10th January 2025 at 6pm.  The EOI can be found here: https://forms.office.com/e/3qNDcNPRMG

A success at HPC has been the implementation of a Nurse Led Occupational Health Service (Hinkley Health) accessible to everyone engaged in the construction of the HPC build. A similar Health Service (Sizewell Health) is to be set up at SZC, building upon the experience, success, lessons learned and best practice of Hinkley Health. 
      Sizewell Health will work to reduce the ask on local health services that a mainly itinerant workforce could bring, such that there is the minimum impact for these. The service will also work with local educational institutions to support the education and development of students in a variety of health courses throughout the lifetime of the project, with onsite placements and mentorship of students, also engaging on courses delivering real life experience in the lecture theatre setting, on working within Construction / Occupational Healthcare to a possible future workforce.
      The requirement will see a progressive increase in scope of service, resource & supporting infrastructure commensurate with the workforce profile and corresponding site/programme activities. The Occupational Health (OH) provision of Sizewell Health is being undertaken by a different health provider, requiring close and good working relationships to ensure the smooth running of the entire service.
      The health service will be structured around managing the health of the construction worker with a three-tier approach encapsulating the worker, the workplace and wellbeing - Prevention of Ill Health, Fitness to Work and a Treatment Service.
      The service provider will be innovative in the services it provides,working closely with SZC Occupational Health and Wellbeing Manager. Treatment and services to be offered on-site will include but not be limited to:
      -	First Aid and First Responder Emergency Care Level 3 (FREC3) (or similar) training

Through the project's Delivery Steering Group, Northern and TransPennine Express have carried out analysis which has identified that additional platform capacity is needed at the airport in order to realise the full benefit of longer train services serving the airport.
      
      The scheme is part of a package of proposed measures in the Manchester area that are being designed/planned to boost capacity and resilience, emanating from the Cross Manchester Capacity and Reliability Improvement Study. Improving the operation of train services in the centre of Manchester and providing further capacity at Manchester Airport station, aligns with the strategic aims of Network Rail, TfGM, TfN and the wider industry.  This project in in Tranche 1 of the Manchester and North West Transformation Programme (MNTP):
       
      A remodelling of the station at Manchester Airport, specifically a platform addition or extension of multiple platforms, or provision of a new turnback facility, will be essential to accommodate the planned implementation of longer rolling stock services.
           
      The redevelopment of these platforms will enable permissive working of two 6x24m (144m) trains, in two of the four platforms at the Airport Station. This will allow for the unaltered retention of all existing TOC services both originating and terminating at the Airport Station under 'double-stacking' conditions.

The saline lagoon hosts a range of waders and wildfowl, but in summer it dries out hugely. This makes the pool hypersaline and unable to support important flora and fauna.

The wet grassland part of the field also struggles to hold water. Although natural rills can be seen they are ill-defined and need refreshing. There is huge predation pressure around this field from foxes and badgers, meaning even if ground nesting birds successfully breed, their chicks cannot survive.

This project will improve the habitats here by:
-	Improving water control by installing a sluice
-	Improving the saline lagoon by reprofiling the steep sided bank
-	Creating wet features in the grassland to provide muddy edges for wader feeding
-	Creating a clear boundary between the sections of the field by installing a low bund

      The scheme is for the design and delivery of an East facing turnback, located on the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Line (ELR: MVE1) adjacent to the existing Salford Hope Street (Cemex) sidings between Salford Central Station and the Oldfield Road Bridge.
      
      At Victoria Station, the through platforms also accommodate terminating trains. The extended time to terminate and turnback in the platforms restricts platform availability for through services. The provision of the turnback siding will allow terminating services from the East arriving at Victoria to clear the platform, travel to the turnback siding and await their next turn of duty, clear of the station.
      
      There is the further benefit of an additional stop at Salford Central Station for passengers to disembark for Manchester Spinningfields, a major employment location in the city centre. The turnback would also act as a service recovery measure during times of service perturbation.
      
      The turnback is to consist of two roads, to accommodate trains up to 8 car x 24m in one road and 6 car x 24m in a second road; with access to and from platforms 3-6 at Manchester Victoria via existing connections.  The new east facing turnback shall also be able to operate as a berthing/storage siding, with walking routes to allow train crew to access and egress the railway.

The current SSR is a portable Commercial OFF The Shelf (COTS) radar that is deployed when the submarine has surfaced, carried to the bridge fin by the crew, clamped to the boat structure, plugged into a vessel power socket and operated. The SSR operates as a second radar or as a backup, should the primary radar fail. It is used to detect the whereabouts of other surface objects and coastlines and is of particular importance when the vessel is approaching or leaving harbour, or in busy shipping areas.

The SSR equipment is stored within the submarine when not in use and deployed to the bridge fin when surfaced through a bespoke carriage solution. Currently, this is a bag and pulley system for the carriage and modified COTS mounts for attachment of the radome and display to the vessel mast/structure respectively. 

The current and previous SSR solutions were subject to high failure rates.

The MRUP DT are planning to run a competition via the Competitive Flexible Procedure (Procurement Act 2023) for suitable suppliers to bid.

The goal is to leverage industry capabilities to deliver a more innovative solution that addresses availability issues and aligns better with platform environmental requirements, including electromagnetic compatibility and toxicity. The capability is required for a period of 5 years (Refer to additional text). 

It is the Authority&apos;s intent to invite suppliers to a Market Engagement Event who can demonstrate they are commercially compliant and can meet the technical requirements of being able to support the RN Subsurface SSR. During the Market Engagement Event the MRUP DT will give a presentation which will describe the SSR operating environment and provide an opportunity for suppliers to engage with questions they may have.

This Market Engagement Event will take place via Microsoft Teams on Monday 16th June 2025 at 1000. Invites to the event will be sent to interested parties in due course.

What: Asset Verification Programme (AVP) to generate a rich dataset (e.g. Asset Registers) of all assets up to and including Level 4 (sub-system) across all the programme in-scope buildings and infrastructure. 

Why: As well as the programme delivering greater assurance on asset portfolio, improved asset specification, defect visibility, waste reduction in works triage and improved risk management, the enhanced data quality will allow accurate benchmarking of future contracts for service delivery with similar reductions in contractor risk allowance and service scope certainty.

Where: His Majesty's Naval Base Portsmouth (HMNB(P), Hampshire, PO1 3LS, UK.

When: Anticipated commencement from Aug/Sep 2025 - estimated 12-14 months duration.

How: Data collection via KBS' current dedicated FM software platform/survey tool and level of detail and asset type governed by a Naval Base Master Asset Hierarchy (will be provisioned). Tablets (Android) will be issued to the Surveyors for ease of data collection. A dedicated Project Team will form the controlling and directing element for the programme duration. The programme also requires building floorplans, space types and room numbers to be revalidated and KBS welcome modern approaches to capturing and digitising this data including partial automated asset recognition.

KBS Maritime - Introduction

KBS Maritime is a joint venture between KBR and BAE Systems, bringing together two global players with a rich heritage of delivering excellence, innovation and reliability. The joint venture will combine the expertise of KBR as a global leader in infrastructure asset management and services with BAE Systems' experience and capability within Portsmouth Naval Base.  KBS Maritime are delivering an ambitious, modern and enduring change to the Portsmouth Naval base infrastructure, securing investment in the local community and ensuring fit-for-purpose, world-leading fleet support for the Royal Navy and the UK in the decades ahead.

Part of the UK Ministry of Defence's (MOD) Future Maritime Support Programme (FMSP), KBS Maritime will provide technology-led and data-driven facilities management and dockside services at the base.

Project scopes

Split the existing male toilets into two to create separate Ladies and male facilities. Additional male and female lockers are to be provided as shown on the attached KBS planners layout in the annex.  The locker rooms will require new flooring, heating, lighting and redecoration.

To further improve the building and ensure that it remains compliant, there are additional requirements to upgrade the building: there will be a survey leading to a proposed solution for the roof, which is suffering from serious leaks caused by several holes in the sheeting. Additionally there will be an assessment and possible replacement of fire safety equipment (alarms, dampening, doors), an EICR to comply with BS7671, an upgrade to all ventilation , remedial work to prevent water ingress, and additional decorations to the interior. 
In summary, this Project includes the following work packages:

It is considered that this contract can be awarded using the Negotiated Procedure Without Prior Publication pursuant to Regulation 16(1)(a)(i) of the Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011 (DSPCR 2011) due to an absence of suitable tenders in response to a call for competition.

S65 1HP. This also requires private sector investment (minimum £330,000 ex. vat) to install and run an EV Charging concession as part of the project.

Drummond Street Car Park is a 240-space pay-and-display surface car park well used by commuters and shoppers. It is situated on the edge of Rotherham Town Centre, across the road from the central markets complex and has approximately 2000 households within a ten-minute walk time. The main town taxi rank is conveniently accessible from the car park and is approximately 200m away, as is the A630 with an annual average daily flow of 35,158 vehicles (2023).

An initial Request for Information (RFI) related to this project was issued in March 2023 and the information provided was extremely helpful. More recently a second RFI was issued for further clarification from the market (Notice reference 2024/S 000-040487).

The fixed budget for the Design & Build of the Solar PV Canopy is £1,050,000 excluding VAT.
Supplier minimum contribution for EV Infrastructure is £330,000 excluding VAT.
EV Charging revenue estimate for the proposed 15 year period is  £4.158M excluding VAT.
Total value is £5.208m excluding VAT, £6.25M inclusive of VAT.

The contract value has been calculated by reference to the potential revenue that the Council considers could be collected by the Concessionaire through the provision of the Services for the entire contract duration. However, the value of the Contract is ultimately dependent on the vagaries of the market and the above income figure does not carry any guarantee of value or volume of business over the contract term.

The service will be split into two lots as follows:

The contract is split into two Lots, Lot 1 Primary Framework Providers (Main and Alternate) and Lot 2 Secondary Framework Providers (backup).

Lot 1 Primary Framework Providers: up to ten main service providers will be appointed; two in each of the defined contractual neighbourhoods (please see map below outlining the areas). It is proposed that the main service providers will operate on a 'week on' and 'week off' basis. This means that, on their 'week on', main service providers will accept minimum 80% of all referrals; on their 'week off', the main service provider will be expected to accept up to 20 % of referrals. The reason for this is to allow the service provider time to embed the support plan for each person referred. The two main service providers in each neighbourhood should work in partnership to ensure 100% of packages are accepted.

Lot 2 Secondary Framework Providers: up to five backup providers covering the full borough (all 5 zones) accepting packages of care when the Lot 1 providers are unable (must not exceed 600 hours unless in exceptional circumstances agreed by the Commissioner/ Council).

This EOI is being conducted following the MoJ Roundtable event, held on 8th May 2025. 

The MoJ are pleased to invite organisations to participate in an Innovation Den to showcase their ideas on how we can address some of the challenges faced within the justice system and to contribute meaningfully to the national dialogue on the future of our justice system. Based on the MOJ's confidence in the submissions, which will cover transformational impact, innovation and alignment with our
selected key themes, the MoJ may select a range of organisations (likely between 5 to 10) to attend an Innovation Den, which will include representation from our Ministerial Team. Any submissions that are not taken through initially may be kept on file for future consideration.

The key focus of this EOI is across the following three themes:
1. Theme 1 - Health, Wellbeing and Behavioural Analytics
Assessing how emerging technologies, particularly wearables and digital biomarkers, can detect drug use, monitor physical and mental health, evaluate intervention outcomes and support lasting behavioural change. The focus includes methods that enable early intervention and personalised support in justice settings.

2. Theme 2 - Identity, Access and Compliance Monitoring 
Exploring how technology, including biometric tools, wearables, drug detection and secure authentication systems, can remotely and reliably verify identity, confirm location and monitor compliance in real time. The focus includes scalable, tamper-resistant solutions that enable more flexible forms of supervision.

3. Theme 3 - Non-Custodial and Community-Based Monitoring
Investigating the use of smart technologies to create a 'prison outside of prison', combining wearables, geolocation and behavioural monitoring to support structured, remotely supervised routines in the community. This includes innovations that strengthen enforcement, encourage desistance and enhance public protection.

The RTPI consortium members are seeking input from the market for the provision, installation and ongoing support for a bus real time passenger information system. This will include migrating existing RTPI display assets from multiple providers into one system and exploring  the provision of solutions other than displays to disseminate bus RTPI to bus users.

At present, it is undecided if the local authorities will procure a new RTPI contract on their own or as a consortium.  This may be a simple contract for the services required or the setting up of a new framework, similar to that procured before. Each local authority is currently assessing the pros and cons for the two procurement options and will confirm their preference in the next few months.

This market assessment is not part of the procurement process, but is purely investigative in nature, to potentially assist the RTPI consortium members in defining a specification, tender document and contract for the project.  

Each of the local authorities wishes to understand the current market position better via the questions supplied below.   

The same information will be gathered from all providers who have been invited to participate in the soft market testing exercise.

Please note, this advert relates to a soft market testing exercise only and is NOT a call for competition.

Any contracts for services or supplies relating to this exercise will be subject to a separate procurement process in accordance with the Procurement Act 2023 (published 24th February 2025) and involvement in the soft market testing does not give the consultant / contractor any advantage in the separate procurement process.

All participants in this soft market testing exercise shall be responsible for their own costs in relation to it (including third party costs) and the RTPI consortium members shall have no liability to any participant.

Under The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) the Police have a statutory requirement to provide an AA when dealing with a suspect who is a juvenile or vulnerable adult, but they cannot provide the AA themselves, as they must be independent from the police.

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) introduced the provision of Appropriate Adults (AA) to safeguard the interests of vulnerable adults and juveniles suspected of a criminal offence. An AA's role is to ensure that vulnerable people are treated fairly, with respect for their rights and entitlements and that they can understand and participate effectively in criminal proceedings related to the investigation and/or their detention.

Last year, the Town Council invested in new festoon lighting. However, the other Town Council owned decorations, including cross motifs and lamp post motifs, reached the end of their lifespan and were recycled earlier this year.  Saltash  Town  Council  (""the  Town  Council"")  has  taken  this  opportunity  to  invest  in lighting not just for Christmas but for various events throughout the year.  The  Town  Council  is  now  seeking  tenders  from  suitably  qualified  and  experienced contractors to provide not only a Christmas Lighting Display but also a lighting display that can be used for various events and public holidays such as Easter, Valentine's Day, Remembrance, and any other Town-organised / national events.  The  scope  of  work  involves  design,  supply,  installation,  maintenance,  removal  and storage (if required) of lights and decorations.    The Town Council is looking for new designs and ideas, mixing modern with traditional, catering  to  all  ages,  with  a  Cornish  theme.  The  Town  Council  is  interested  in  an environmentally  friendly  approach  to  displays,  e.g.  energy  efficient  LED's,  solar options, etc. for a contractual period of three-years.  

Tenderers are invited to use their experience and their product ranges and design knowledge to present a scheme for Saltash that enhances Fore Street, inclusive of Victoria Gardens to the Waterside - presentation to be included in the tender submission.

The scheme  should  create  a  focal  point  on Fore Street,  with  versatile/projection lighting  that  can  be  utilised  all  year-round  for  various  Town  Events  and  Public Holidays, including but not limited to, May Fair, Regatta, Easter, and Valentine's Day. The Town Council wishes to have a bright and cheerful light display during the festive season that complements the town's high street, Victoria Gardens and the  Waterside.

The park currently features a range of play equipment with several years of serviceable life remaining. The objective of this tender is to enhance the play environment by adding new equipment that integrates seamlessly with the existing infrastructure. Maintenance requirements outlined in this ITT apply only to the new equipment supplied through this tender.

The objectives of this project are:
1.	To provide new, safe, and inclusive play equipment that complements the existing installations and caters to diverse age groups and abilities.
2.	To ensure the installation is completed to the highest standards of safety and compatibility with existing equipment.

This tender is for a project designed to complement any existing serviceable equipment with new play equipment as suggested in Appendix A, together with appropriate surfaces.  The new design should extend the play appeal and suit nearly walkers/toddlers and children up to the age of 12 years. 

Bidders should offer proposals to match, extend or replace the safety surfaces under items of existing equipment that will remain. 

The play area should be zoned to allow younger children to play away from, albeit nearby, older children. 

Specific play equipment should also cater for children with both special educational needs (eg sensory play for those with autistic spectrum disorders) and those with physical disabilities. 

New equipment should be hard wearing/replaceable with respect to vandalism and consider that the park is surrounded on three sides by residential housing. Any proposed items of new equipment should have a comprehensive maintenance plan. 

A list of specific improvement suggestions, including feedback from our local consultation is included in Appendix A. 
The successful tenderer will be responsible for:

This initiative aims to break down barriers to employment and provide sustainable job opportunities for individuals with complex needs. By joining forces with us, you'll not only help transform lives but also contribute to the growth and productivity of our local economy. 
What is Connect to Work? -The Get Britain Working White Paper, released in November 2024, introduced the key supported employment programme, which aims to  help eligible individuals secure sustainable, long-term employment. Currently, it is estimated that there are about 3million economically inactive people in the UK, of whom 1.9million people would like to work, but require support to do so. In 2023, 9,600 Buckinghamshire residents were economically inactive and wished to work but required support to do so. Buckinghamshire Council expects to support 720 individuals (at the peak) at an anticipated cost of up to £2.5million in the peak year, delivered over an initial three-year period, with the opportunity to extend to 5 years. It will help connect local work, health and skills support and help eligible participants to secure sustainable work through a voluntary supported employment model, adhering to Individual Placement & Support (IPS) and Supported Employment Quality Framework (SEQF) frameworks. Through this, the programme will expand the use of the proven five stage Supported Employment model of 'place, train and maintain'. 
 How will it be managed and delivered?- Buckinghamshire Council is the Accountable Body. Working with the Department for Work and Pensions, Buckinghamshire Council will oversee the programme including procuring and managing delivery partner to provide sufficient high-quality support to participants and employers to make the programme a success. Our ambition is to deliver this programme in partnership with one high-quality provider, who are able to meet set targets for supporting economically inactive adults in Buckinghamshire into work. We are looking for delivery partner with considerable and demonstrable experience of providing supported employment programmes which deliver to both individuals with complex barriers, and employers who will provide the sustainable jobs. Partner that succeed in the selection process, must either already deliver IPS and SEQF, have robust training plans or intend to deliver both models in a consortium or subcontracting model which is clearly demonstrated in the application. process.  Further, the successful bidder must show developed relationships with employers within Buckinghamshire (or a commutable distance given the target audience) with the ability to identify employment opportunities and support employers to provide successful, sustainable job outcomes.

The number of people requiring medical treatment at any music or similar event will vary considerably with the activities being undertaken, along with the environmental conditions surrounding the event.  Even at a small, low risk event, there is the possibility of collapses or other medical emergencies.  There is extensive evidence demonstrating the importance of rapid lifesaving first aid in these circumstances.

The range of medical conditions can also vary enormously and there should be adequate capability to manage a wide range of traumatic and medical situations, varying from the trivial to the life threatening.  Special consideration needs to be given to drug and alcohol issues, along with psychiatric problems.

It is important to ensure that the spectrum of care is available, commensurate with the size of the event.

The Role:
•	Ensuring that there is an appropriate level of medical, first aid and ambulance provision at an event that will minimise the impact on the local NHS services.
•	Undertake a medical, ambulance and first aid assessment.
•	A medical staffing plan should be made prior to the event to ensure that staff are deployed appropriately
•	Medical provision should be provided for the full duration of the events, including build up and derig.

The ISE Template has provided a focus for dialogue with the EA on the content of ISEs and detailed feedback has previously been provided to the Employer by the Environment Agency [8].


The Employer (NWS) now plans to develop ISE for two Search Areas (referred to in this CTS as Copeland and Theddlethorpe) and plans to submit permit applications in 2028 to undertake intrusive investigations works within these areas. These Search Area-specific ISE will synthesis studies and assessments, e.g. feasibility studies and characterisation plans, that are being produced as part of wider GDF programme delivery. These inputs to the ISE have been termed 'source products'. The Integrated Assurance and Approvals Plan (IAAP) establishes an assurance strategy that envisages the iterative development of the ISE in consultation with the EA. The first iteration involves the development of a 'Trial ISE', which will develop the ISE Template using available 'source products' for one of the Search Areas. Search Area-specific ISE will subsequently be produced and undergo two rounds of development: a 'Draft ISE' and 'Final ISE'.


The objective of the contract is for a Consultant to provide impartial scrutiny of the NWS's approach to developing ISEs, with the intention of building wider stakeholder confidence in the approach being adopted. This scrutiny will also facilitate the identification of risks and opportunities associated with the NWS's approach and will seek to mitigate any cognitive biases that may have also developed.

The Consultant's team should consist of a minimum of two peer reviewers. The peer reviewers should be independent of the Employer's work to develop the ISE and the associated permit applications. Give the novel nature of the ISE and associated permit application, direct experience of the staged regulation guidance and ISE development is therefore not possible.

The peer reviewers should have significant (10 years +) international experience of the development of Environmental Safety Cases for geological disposal facilities and the associated regulatory requirements. The Consultant should describe in their tender how the skills and experience of their team will benefit the peer review process and overall quality of the ISE submissions

We are seeking Expressions of Interest (EOI) from local regionally based tech specialist providers with experience of delivering activities aligned to the objectives. 

Together we will deliver a programme of activity that meet the following objectives: 
  
1) Deliver projects to support regional tech entrepreneurship and strengthen regional digital ecosystems - this may include harnessing community-building effects of in-person, local programmes to develop strong regional networks of tech founders and innovators, driving further innovation through collaboration, investment readiness, knowledge sharing or signposting further available support for founders.
2) Promote the strength and competitiveness of all regional tech companies to potential investors - thereby boosting investor confidence, understanding of the sector and inspiring future entrepreneurs to enter the market.
3) Promote best practice and learnings that can be scaled beyond this programme - facilitate the sharing of insights and best practice across different regional digital ecosystems to encourage peer learning and ecosystem-wide benefits and develop advice to inform future DSIT policy development.
4) Ensure efforts to support regional tech are sustainable and enduring. Demonstrate how the outputs of the project will continue to benefit the UK tech sector after the initial government funding period has ended, for example through building legacy assets.

To apply for the EOI, you are required to make your submission via the Panacea e-tendering platform. Please register as a supplier on the Panacea Supplier Platform at the following web address: https://app.panacea-software.com/growth

Currently, multiple VCSE providers deliver wellbeing-related services across the ICS footprint. These include:
- Wellbeing Hubs
- Happy Hubs
- Positive Pathways for 18-25s
- Adult Positive Pathways

This fragmented model has resulted in duplicated services, variable quality and access, inconsistent outcomes, and inefficiencies in service delivery. The Commissioners are seeking to undertake a single procurement approach to deliver a whole-system model that is equitable, consistent, and outcomes-focused.
The procurement process will be structured into two distinct lots to better meet the varying needs of the population and to streamline service delivery. These are:
a) Lot 1 - Healthy Mind Services- currently known as 'Wellbeing Hubs', 'Happy Hubs' and 'Positive Pathways' Services. This lot will focus on delivering community-based mental wellbeing support, promoting resilience, early intervention, and social connection.
b) Lot 2 - Depression Wellbeing Calls - a targeted service aimed at providing proactive support for people who have been newly diagnosed with depression by their Primary Care Practitioner and/or have been prescribed medication, referred to Talking Therapies or both.
The Market Engagement event will take place virtually via MS Teams on Monday 12th May 2025 at 13:00hrs - 14:00hrs.

The event will offer an opportunity to engage with stakeholders and for prospective service providers to learn more about the service. The procurement process and timetable will also be shared.

The highway network is a key community asset, supporting both the local and national economy, contributing to the character and environment of the Borough.  A well-maintained network supports community mobility and accessibility essential to the wider aspirations of sustaining an inclusive society. The singular importance of management and maintenance of the highway network, for all categories of users, places an increasing demand on management systems to support service delivery. 
The network contributes to delivery of the Client's strategic objectives and the shared priorities of national and local government. Efficient transport links are vital for a thriving population and economy, providing access to employment, education, healthcare, retail outlets and leisure and to all the other services and supplies we rely upon to support our needs. Maintenance of the network is vital to ensure it can continue to provide the principal element of the overall transport network. 
The Client's Highway Management and Maintenance Plan (HMMP) provides guidance on the policies and procedures informing our highway maintenance practices, consistent with the Client's Vision and Values. It is based upon the three (3) Codes of Practice published by the roads Liaison Group with the support of the Department of Transport, which the Client adopts subject to our local variations described in the HMMP. 
""Well-lit Highways - Code of Practice for Highway Lighting Management"", published in November 2004. 
""Well-maintained Highways - Code of Practice for Highway Maintenance Management"", published in July 2005. 
""Management of Highway Structures - A Code of Practice"" published in September 2005. 
The HMMP recognises that RBWMs highway maintenance cannot operate in isolation from the Client's other functions and responsibilities. The underpinning strategy demands a logical and systematic approach to achieve value for money and continuous improvement. It encompasses the Client's statutory duties, the wish to maintain and enhance the value of the network asset and the necessity to be responsive to the needs of the community. 
The Client has a statutory duty, under the Highways Act 1980, to maintain the highway network within the Borough. Management and maintenance of the network is the responsibility of the Highways Asset Management Group within the Operations and Customer Service Directorate. 

All the above must be maintained in a safe condition (with partners) in spite of the increasing pressures created by increasing traffic volumes, heavier and larger lorries and works carried out by public utilities.",,,"South East","45233139 ","RBWM Procurement",procurement@rbwm.gov.uk,"Town Hall",,MAIDENHEAD,SL61RF,England,01628796285,,,,,01/04/2026,31/03/2040,24/06/2025,NO,,No,No,No,Services,65800000,114800000,,,,,,,"OpenOJEU ",,13:00

Please note that the following requirements are in DRAFT form, and are attached to this notice.

The purpose of sharing these DRAFT requirements is to inform DESNZ's understanding of the market's perception. Feedback is requested solely via the Microsoft Forms Questionnaire included in the ""DP2 Draft Requirements Supplier Questionnaire"" document attached to this notice - further information can be found in that attached document. 

Any responses received as part of this engagement will not be evaluated as part of a tender response and will not prejudice any involvement in a future procurement process.  

The Authority reserves the right:
•	To amend these requirements in advance of the formal ITT publication, which will be no earlier than May 2025;
•	Not to proceed with the DP2 procurement.

Suppliers are not entitled to claim from the Authority any costs or expenses that you may incur if you decide to start preparing your tender.

DP2 Data Room Update  
A Data Room for the potential DP2 procurement has been created within the Department's eSourcing portal, Jaggaer (accessible here: https://beisgroup.ukp.app.jaggaer.com/)

As previous communications and market engagement events have stated, the Fund Administration & Disbursement Services DPS (FAADS) RM6322 is DESNZ's indicative route to market. To access this Data Room, potential tenderers must register as a supplier on the FAADS DPS under Filter 5 - Full Programme Management; attached to this notice is a DP2 market engagement PowerPoint with instructions on how to sign up to the DPS.

The purpose of this Data Room is to share information from the Department and any incumbent suppliers with the market that is related to this requirement, prior to the release of a tender. Due to the confidential nature of some of this information, suppliers must sign and return a mandatory Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Once signed up to the FAADS DPS, please contact hthcommercial@energysecurity.gov.uk to receive the NDA and any further instructions.

ITT_2015 has been created for the purpose of sharing documents via a Data Room in Jaggaer before the ITT is released. The dates and times listed are solely for the purpose of creating the Data Room, and will be amended pending the outcome of internal governance and approvals processes. Should an ITT be published for this requirement, it will be done via this Jaggaer project (itt_2015).

Please note: There are currently no documents in the Data Room - this is a notice to inform you of its creation, location and our intent to publish information in there soon.

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is inviting tenders for the provision of Court Appointed Intermediary Services (CAIS), to support vulnerable defendants in the criminal jurisdiction and vulnerable parties and witnesses in the civil, family and tribunal jurisdictions. These services will be provided in courts and tribunals in England and Wales and tribunals in Scotland.

Intermediaries facilitate impartial communication to enable complete, coherent and accurate communication between vulnerable people and the courts/tribunals. Intermediaries may be instructed to provide an assessment of a person&apos;s communication needs, and provide recommendations on measures that could be put in place by the court to support vulnerable people, young people, children and other individuals who may need assistance during court proceedings. The intermediary may also be required to attend hearings to provide such assistance and support.

For the avoidance of doubt, the MoJ is only seeking tenders in relation to intermediary services that currently fall outside the remit of the MoJ Witness Intermediary Scheme (MoJ WIS).

The MASP framework seeks providers with the ability to manage multiple simultaneous bookings, and the capability to recruit, train and manage intermediaries to support a range of vulnerabilities, for deployment nationally.

The ASP framework seeks experienced and qualified intermediaries to support bookings on demand.

There is no limit to the number of service providers awarded a place on either framework, however a service provider may not hold a place on both the MASP and ASP frameworks simultaneously.

The MoJ is managing this procurement in accordance with its general obligations under UK law and specifically in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCRs) and the Light Touch Regime contained within Regulations 74 to 77.

The framework agreements are dynamic frameworks and a hybrid of a framework agreement and dynamic purchasing system. As such, the framework agreements will be re-opened at six month intervals for the admission of new service providers who qualify against the selection and award criteria outlined in the procurement documents.

The C2 Targeting Navigations and Communications Team (C2TNC DT), part of the Ministry of Defence (""the Authority""), intends to enter into a one-year option contract extension with DXC for the Advanced Mission Planning Aid (AMPA) (""the Contract""). The AMPA In-Service Support (ISS) contract provides Design Organisation support and Post Design Services for the 3 variants which because of their commonality realises an economy of scale benefit.

Due to mission data generated by AMPA being referenced when airborne, the system is deemed to impact air safety and the supplier, DXC Technology, is required to be accredited by the Military Aviation Authority (MAA) as a Design Organisation (DO).  It is not believed that any other MoD MPS provider currently holds this certification.  

The original AMPA ISS included 2+1-year support for Hawk TMk1 and Typhoon so providing cover until 31 Mar 2025, but the delays and continuing uncertainty require this is extended to 2+2 years which will align with the end of the current contract which is 31 March 2026.  A change of supplier is not practical as it would introduce significant technical and assurance issues for a mission critical capability affecting air safety without offering any performance, time, cost, or operational benefit.

The site consists of two interconnected buildings in central London. Primary plant, including chillers, cooling towers, fresh air ventilation, boilers, and pumps, is located across basement and roof levels. Local systems are supported by supplementary plant on the office floors, where comfort conditions are maintained via a 4-pipe fan coil unit (FCU) system.
The existing Trend BMS infrastructure is a combination of legacy and partially upgraded components, including IQ3, IQL, IQ4, and IQEco controllers. A partial system upgrade was completed in 2018, which included:
- Replacement of selected IQ3 main plant controllers with IQ4 equivalents
- Upgrade from Trend 963 to Trend IQVision graphical user interface
- Integration of two separate site BMS networks into a unified IP network
- Replacement of some IQL terminal unit controllers with IQEco units
However, the 2018 upgrade did not address all legacy hardware. A significant portion of IQ3 controllers and associated I/O modules remain in operation. This project seeks to complete the BMS modernisation by:
- Replacing all remaining IQ3 and IQL controllers with IQ4 and IQEco units, respectively
- Removing obsolete I/O modules and integrating new hardware with existing field wiring
- Rationalising the network architecture to ensure optimal performance and future maintainability
- Enhancing the operator interface, trend logging, and graphical capabilities via IQVision
- Integrating additional monitoring elements, including return air sensors, sump status, and alarm functionality
The building shall remain live and operational throughout the duration of the works. The Contractor shall ensure minimal disruption to occupants and business operations, with particular care taken in occupied and secure zones. The works must be carried out in phases, with any required isolation or shutdowns carefully coordinated with the CH Facilities Management team and subject to prior approval.

NHS Arden and GEM CSU are inviting suitably qualified and experienced providers to express their interest in delivering a S12 Digital Solution.
A digital solution is required which automates the management of the Mental Health Act S12 Assessment process. 
The digital platform will need to include the following functions to allow the automation of the S12 Assessment process.
•	Only accredited S12 Doctors should be able to access the system meaning that pre-authorisation checks that the Doctor has been accredited has already taken place. These will need to be regularly checked and updated by the provider.
•	S12 Doctors should be able to add their availability calendar to the system which means professionals can see which Doctors are available to be called upon at any time. 
•	The AMHP - (Allied Mental Health Professional - accredited social worker under the powers of the MHA) should be able to open and manage their S12 caseload on the system.
•	Doctors must be able to add their information on the system when they have completed their assessment, leading to automatic payment in the next monthly scheduled payment run.
•	The software provider will need to provide training for Doctors, AMHPs and admin staff to use the system effectively and provide online support to all users.
•	The ICB will need to receive detailed activity reports regarding numbers, times and dates of assessments along with providers which can aid resource allocation. 

The purpose of this advert is to invite the market to engage and provide feedback on the draft specification. This will provide the ICB with valuable information to ensure that the service and specification is fit for purpose.

The deadline for market engagement responses is by 17:00 hours on Tuesday 6th May 2025. Please note this is a market testing exercise and does not commit the ICB to carry out any further procurement process. Any future opportunity will be carried out in accordance with the ICB's procurement obligations under the Procurement Act 2023.

The overarching contract period of this Framework Agreement is from the 01/04/2024 - 31/03/2028 (a total of 4-years), with this Tranche 2 (the re-opening of the framework) period from the 18/06/2025 - 17/06/2026. The Framework will re-open on annual basis, as outlined in the tender documentation.

The key objectives of this Framework Agreement (FA) are to:

- Establish a compliant contracting mechanism to allow the Authority to quickly source appropriate, suitable, capable providers to deliver place-based services.

-To establish an Approved Provider List of providers who have met and continue to meet the Authority&apos;s minimum selection criteria over the term of the FA.

-To establish a transparent Call-Off and Award Procedure that can be adapted to the individual requirements of each Call-Off contract whereby the Authority can effectively narrow the pool of eligible providers from the Approved Provider List to those most appropriate and capable to be Invited to Tender based on pre-published Categories.

The scope of services is a range of purpose led, place-based, supplementary community services that are uniquely suited to the Voluntary sector and small-to-medium-enterprises (SMEs). The framework aims to enable NHS MSE ICB to develop a process that will support the community and voluntary organisations of any size to have a governance process in place to support with future commissioning and best utilise funding as it is available. The framework aims to enable Commissioners to best distribute funding and commission services at pace, particularly during in seasonal pressures, and to cover a wide range of support services within the MSE geographical footprint. Services in this FA include Locality Specific Community Services, Voluntary Sector Specialised Services, Supplementary Community Services (Adults and Children&apos;s Services), and Supplementary Mental Health Services across the Mid and South Essex geography.

This FA has no activity guarantee, with a minimum contract value of £0.00 per annum. This notice has reflected a minimum value of £1.00 due to an error on this form which prevents the true figure of £0.00 per annum being illustrated in Section II.1.7) of this form. The minimum contract value of £0.00 pa and maximum indicative aggregate contract value £500million.

The headline mechanisms for undertaking a Call Off Procedure under this FA are set out later in the procurement pack and will be detailed within each Call-Off Invitation to Tender (ITT).

In order to be accepted onto the FA, all Bidders responding to the Stage 1: Request to Participate will complete the mandatory Selection Questionnaire, Qualification and Technical envelopes within the e-procurement portal.

Processes and tools that were adequate for managing a smaller organisation cannot be easily scaled up to manage the growing volume of activity and number of projects.

There is currently no central list of all projects and activity across the MCA, or consistent recording of project attributes.  Whilst individual business areas keep track, this is done inconsistently across the organisation and relies on heavy use of spreadsheets - compromising accuracy, completeness and timeliness of reporting.  Summary reporting against strategic objectives and business plan deliverables is a very unreliable, cumbersome and manual process.

Project progress is currently monitored through the collation of 'highlight' reports from project managers.  The format for these reports is currently either MS Excel or MS Word.  Whilst the Excel version does provide some structured data for onward reporting it is a manual process to transform the data into a suitable format. The quality and completeness of the reports is inconsistent and there is considerable manual validation and correction required.  The Word version provides mainly unstructured data and so the process for reporting from these is even more resource intensive. In addition, with over 100 projects, the number of highlight reports that are manually requested, checked and then filed is significant.  

Purpose of Procurement

The objective of this work is to ensure that the MCA has a robust and accurate set of key information about all projects in development and delivery.  The data will be in a format that can be maintained and accessed by teams across the regional partnership and that can be used to meet many different reporting requirements.  This will facilitate oversight and assurance of developing proposals and management of the performance of schemes in delivery.  It will enable the MCA to evidence how much it has invested in projects across each strategic priority, how well those projects are performing against plan and what outputs and outcomes they're delivering.

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) introduced the provision of Appropriate Adults (AA) to safeguard the interests of vulnerable adults and juveniles suspected of a criminal offence. An AA's role is to ensure that vulnerable people are treated fairly, with respect for their rights and entitlements and that they can understand and participate effectively in criminal proceedings related to the investigation and/or their detention. AAs can also reduce the risk of miscarriages of justice because evidence obtained from vulnerable suspects which, by virtue of their vulnerability, could lead to unsafe convictions. 
Under PACE the Police have a statutory requirement to provide an AA when dealing with a suspect who is a juvenile or vulnerable adult, but they cannot provide the AA themselves, as they must be independent from the police.

The Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent will be conducting a tender process in May 2025. Prior to the tender publication a supplier engagement event will take place on 29th April 2025 via on-line Teams meeting at 10.00am.

Based at the University of Bristol, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), is a world-leading birth cohort study. More than 14,000 pregnant women were recruited into the study between April 1991 and December 1992. These women, the children arising from the pregnancy and now also their grandchildren have been followed up in detail ever since.
ALSPAC is one of the most detailed studies of its kind in the world, providing the international research community with a rich resource for the study of the environmental and genetic factors that affect a person's health and development. The ALSPAC web site describes the cohort and available data (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/), and hosts data documentation and catalogues. The ALSPAC access policy details how data can be accessed by researchers (http://www.
bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/dataaccess/).

REQUIREMENT
Funding has been secured from the Medical Research Foundation and Medical Research Council to measure steroid hormones from historic hair samples collected when ALSPAC child participants were approximately 15 years old. These new measures will be integrated into the larger ALSPAC dataset providing an invaluable resource for researchers investigating the most pressing health questions of our time.",,"BS1 5DS","Any region","73000000 ","Louise Parton",louise.parton@bristol.ac.uk,"4th Floor, Augustine&apos;s Courtyard, Orchard Lane",,Bristol,"BS1 5DS",England,0,,,"https://tenders.bris.ac.uk ",,12/05/2025,12/05/2026,28/04/2025,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,129000,,,,,,,,"OpenNonOJEU ",,12:00

There is a clear separation between the Housing Provider (Landlord) and the Support Provider. Assured Shorthold Tenancies are generally in place, enabling individuals to benefit from a permanent rather than short-term or time limited living arrangement. Supported living services generally require registration with CQC to provide the regulated activity of personal care.

WCC is looking to develop its next generation, strategic data platform, to underpin its reporting, analytics, AI and personalisation goals. The platform will leverage Snowflake as its core data warehouse, likely supported by a range of other products and services. The programme of work will involve consolidation of a range of existing data platforms through migration activities, as well as identifying and processing new datasets to fuel new data products. 
 
The programme will likely involve several phases. In first instance, the contract will focus on Phase One, covering delivery items related to the Data hub and Data deliverables. Future phases, that are in scope, will be subject to variations throughout the contract term, as and when required as the programme progresses and subject to budget approval.  
 
Phase 1
The initial phase will be to design the new data warehouse environment, then migrate and refactor the existing corporate data warehouse. It will involve discovery and analysis around the data sets, privacy considerations, etc. of the data held in the existing Microsoft SQL Server environment. These datasets and their data pipelines will need to be migrated onto the Snowflake environment. Downstream dependencies such as Power BI dashboards will need to be repointed and if necessary, redesigned. Importantly, this will require extensive refactoring. For example, ingestion may move from SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to Azure Data Factory (ADF) and the overall architectural pattern will move from ETL to ELT. The migration is therefore not a ""lift and shift"" migration. However, the scope will be limited to datasets currently processed into the existing CDW.

It should be noted that the advertised estimated budget of up to £3.87million represents the full potential project and is subject to further budgetary approval. The initial Phase One budget is up to £850,000.00. Further phases and additional expenditure will be confirmed as the programme progresses and are discretionary,  subject to both budgetary approval and the requirements of the council, therefore not guaranteed to the supplier.",,,London,"72263000 ","Westminster City Council",jpeek@westminster.gov.uk,"64 Victoria Street",,London,"SW1E 6QP",England,,www.westminster.gov.uk,,,"This opportunity is being procured via the Crown Commercial Service Spark DPS (RM6094).

Alongside this, we use a separate manual Word document-centred process for handling and approving new and amended Course Units and Programmes. Keeping these two sources of information synchronised by copying and pasting is a time-consuming, manual, and error-prone task, not helped by differing terminology in the Word and CUIP forms.

To achieve this the project is looking to provision a software solution to become a single point of truth for curriculum data, capturing detailed curriculum information and coupling it with management of the University's end-to-end curriculum lifecycle and seamless integration with other key university platforms.

The University is looking for a solution that will accommodate the diverse course offerings available across its three faculties and nine schools, as well as provide a platform for development and innovation for the future.

As a health authority focused entirely on counter fraud work, the NHSCFA is independent from other NHS bodies and directly accountable to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).

According to our latest estimate, the NHS is vulnerable to £1.264 billion worth of fraud each year (source NHSCFA Strategic Intelligence Assessment 2023). The mission of the organisation is to lead the fight against fraud affecting the NHS and wider health service, and protect vital resources intended for patient care.

As an intelligence-led organisation, the NHSCFA will use information from a wide range of sources to build a better understanding of the fraud risks faced by the NHS and develop creative, innovative and proportionate solutions to tackle fraud.

The NHSCFA use complex algorithms and data mining tools as a means to identify both normal behaviour and outliers in NHS data, within which fraudulent behaviour can be found. The resulting analyses are used to support ongoing investigations as well as inform the intelligence picture and guide fraud prevention steps.

One of the products used by the NHSCFA is egress technology, which allows for the secure transfer of email and data. The incumbent supplier is currently Egress Software Technology Ltd.

There is need for continued investment in this work, as ensuring the safety and quality of the major UK cereals for human consumption and animal feed remains a top priority for the agricultural industry.
Continued monitoring of contaminants in cereals across the supply chain is essential in order to provide scientific evidence and assure the cereal industry their products are safe, and of good quality, for use in the domestic and export markets.   The data generated by previous phases of the project has been used to inform discussions on new legislation and growing demands on supply, as well as be a vital source to demonstrate due diligence. 
AHDB is looking for a contractor to undertake the new phase of this project over the next 2 years, with the potential to extend for a further 3 years in 12-month increments (1 August 2025 to 31 July 2030). 
The main purpose of this project is to provide an independent survey of the incidence and levels of key contaminants in representative samples of UK-grown cereals (wheat, barley and oats) and co-products (wheatfeed and oatfeed), to ensure they meet legal compliance guideline limits and are safe for human consumption and animal feed. The project will also monitor current and emerging legislation and contaminant issues which could impact on the safety of cereal-based foods and their acceptability in key home and overseas markets.

The cycle parking at QAT addresses a strong local need due to its proximity to key facilities, including businesses, leisure and shopping areas, hospitality venues, green open spaces, and other amenities. Recreational and sports facilities are also available on site.
The proposed improvements include additional cycle parking spaces and enhancements to safety, security, and accessibility. There are two cycle parking areas at QAT: one inside the car park building and the other outside, which is not covered. Both are at street level. There is a demand for safe, secure, and accessible short-term and long-term cycle parking.
In the undercover cycle parking area, CCC plans to remove all existing cycle stands and ground anchors, adjust fence lines, and screed the floor before installing new cycle stands in a 'toast-rack' setup (consisting of two or more cycle stands securely attached to horizontal steel sections), cargo cycle parking bays with new ground anchors, and signage. An access-controlled area is also proposed, which will require a swing gate fitted with mag locks.
For the external cycle parking area, CCC proposes to remove all existing vegetation, including a semi-mature tree, and all existing cycle stands and concrete hardstanding. The area will then be excavated to install an engineered tree pit with a hardstanding area above, and new root-fixed cycle stands (each stand leg embedded into a concrete foundation).
New trees will be planted after the works are complete.

This requires an end-to-end solution from transport modelling through appraisal analysis to visualisation of results. The scale and expectations of the use of analysis in policy making has increased significantly and we are looking for a system to help us meet that analytical need. While remaining with the same staffing levels.

Stage 1 - Capability Assessment following the shortlisting of suppliers by TASM to identify suppliers that can meet their requirements. Suppliers must be able to answer yes to all the capability assessment questions to become shortlisted for stage 2. A collaborative approach should be demonstrated which allows for requirements to be altered based on needs and risks which we expect to evolve through the discovery, proof of concept and pilot stages. This allows for joint problem solving with prospective suppliers encouraging the latest industry best practices including use of technology.   

Stage 2 - Suppliers who meet all the criteria will be invited to a supplier day to present their capability.

Stage 3 -If you meet the customer's criteria for being invited, your presentation will be evaluated against the published capability assessment criteria and the successful bidder(s) will be notified. If the Department is satisfied your tool meets our requirements you will be invited to tender for the opportunity.  

All responses to Stage 1 should be submitted no later than 16:00 on the 1st April  2025. All responses shall be sent directly via email to jason.thrupp@dft.gov.uk

Much of these are directly delivered by BAL but, in order to fully use its Adult Skills Fund (ASF) allocation and ensure it addresses the key priorities of both the Council and the ESFA, it subcontracts part of its delivery. This enables BAL to deliver to target markets and in geographical areas that it would otherwise be unable to reach.

In the context of this procurement potential providers and bidders are hereafter referred to as subcontractors.

In 2024 BAL established a list of approved providers (subcontractors) for a period of three years maximum, with the option to open annually, or more frequently if required, to invite more to join the list. The opportunity titled Adult Learning - Delivery of Learning (2024) was published on Contracts Finder on 8 April 2024, and last edited on 10 April 2024.

Original opportunity published on Contracts Finder: https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/0dc0da39-18b9-4672-9466-c1721241b91f

In line with the opportunity above BAL is now re-opening this procurement process for the 2025/2026 academic year, for a period of two years maximum, to reach out to additional delivery partners in specific areas of delivery needed to meet the skills gaps within Buckinghamshire.  

All potential providers admitted to the Approved Providers List (i.e. approved providers) will be invited to participate to submit bids in a mini competition to win funding to deliver Adult Education Budget (AEB) and future Adult Skills Funding (ASF) on behalf of The Council. These subcontractors will allow the Council to:

•	To provide immediate provision whilst expanding direct capacity. This might include working with sub-contractors to explore and learn about new sectors prior to investment in resources;
•	Diversify our provision in terms of scope or scale including the development of new SSA areas or geographies linked to new or existing business contacts that BAL alone could not sufficiently provide coverage;
•	To provide access to, or engagement with, a new range of customers;
•	Support smaller providers to develop and grow their specialist provision and improve their quality.

In November 2021, transfers under the scheme became mandated for all Local Authorities to share responsibility nationally and equitably for these children and so that their needs could be met more swiftly with reduced reliance on hotel accommodation.

Oxfordshire has a strong history of responding to the needs of UC&YP and currently has a dedicated countywide UC&YP team to meet the needs of these children upon their arrival.

Q1. We would be very interested in tendering for the Britten Pears Art project. However, given the size and scope of works, we were hoping for an extension of the submission's deadline from the 7th April to the middle of April. This additional time would allow us to price all aspects of the works accurately and ensure a comprehensive submission. 

A1. The submission deadline of 7th April is the Pre Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) process and does not need pricing of works. The date set reflects the need to conclude the PQQ in a timely manner to allow a formal tender process to commence on or around 22nd April. On the basis of the above an extension will not be able to be granted and the submission timeline for the PQQ remains as 7th April 2025.

Tender clarification Nr 2

Q1. We are interested in tendering this scheme, following the SW process can you advise how many tenderers will be selected to tender this scheme?

A1. We would anticipate a minimum of 4nr contractors and a maximum of 6nr would be taken forward for tendering, all subject to suitably qualified PQQ submissions being received.

Tender Clarification Nr 3

Q1. We have downloaded the documents for the Britten Pears Arts Facility PQQ. We note on the Contracts Finder portal the PQQ return is Monday 7th April@5pm via the App Box link, however the PQQ document says to return at 3pm via email to yourself and Michael.
 Can you please clarify which time and method we are to use to submit?

A1. All completed PQQ and associated documents should be uploaded to the BOX link provided before the closing time of 5pm on 7th April.

It will be the first such scheme in the country open to all landlords, no matter whether they are private or social landlords, big or small and is managed by an Independent Implementation Unit. The GLC has seven characteristics and 21 associated criteria relating to what is a good landlord.
The Implementation Unit started operating at the end of 2024 and is in the process of setting up.
The purpose of the evaluation will be to evaluate the following:
1) How the implementation and delivery of the GLC have met its objectives.
2) How the implementation and delivery of the GLC has delivered against each of the GLC criteria and characteristics.
3) The experiences of landlords, tenants and stakeholders in relation to the GLC.
4) Barriers faced and lessons learnt in the implementation and delivery of the GLC.
It is expected that the evaluation of the GLC will use mixed methods, the evaluator will be required to work closely with the Implementation Unit and the GMCA to agree on data collection and processing.

As part of the play area development, the community were consulted upon extensively and the play area is a result of that consultation. This play area incorporated many ideas for a more natural play area rather than the perceived normal lay out of fence and equipment. By utilising both wooden structures and modern equipment, the first natural play area in Hythe was created. 
Since the play area was opened, the area has continued to evolve, however many of the more natural elements such as the wooden play equipment, the felled trees that provide climbing areas and the wooden dens have either come to the end or are coming to the end of their lifespan and as such have or will be removed shortly.
The facility is extremely popular with the community and as a result the Parish Council has committed to provide an interim refurbishment. 
Experienced play area installers are invited to tender for the contract.

Background Information

GOV.UK Pay ('Pay') is a digital payments platform, developed and run by GDS. Pay is a payments product, providing a quick and easy way for the public to make payments for services online and via telephone.

Pay currently supports central government, local authority, police forces and NHS teams to take payments for their services digitally. It automates financial processes and reduces the administration burden on teams, saving time and money that can be reinvested in important public services.

The platform has processed over 94 million transactions since September 2016, with a total value of £6 billion GBP. Services using GOV.UK Pay include HM Passport Office's Apply for a passport.

Pay is a common tool that is built once and used many times by more than 1,000 different public sector services, saving the public sector time, money and reducing duplication of effort. It also offers a consistent, trusted and accessible user experience making it quick and easy for citizens to pay for public sector services. Pay has achieved significant realised benefits, saving public sector money.

Whilst the current contract handles only 17% of payments currently going through GOV.UK Pay it is used by more than 70% of all our services currently taking a payment and is the only option available which enables teams to start taking payments within one working day.

The aim of the service is to provide medical, nursing, and therapeutic inpatient rehabilitation for patients that are registered with a North West London GP.

The objective is to provide multidisciplinary assessments of patients from the local Trust and discharge patients to the most appropriate setting via the trusted assessor team based at Northwick Park Hospital.

In 2017, NHS Harrow borough originally developed a new integrated care pathway for adults and frail elderly people to avoid hospital admissions, support early discharge and promote effective rehabilitation and reablement, wherever possible in a community setting. The main acute hospital, London North West University Hospital Trust, was consistently subject to increasing demands for rehabilitation and acute treatment beds.

Since its inception the Intermediate Care Beds has provided a route for patients who have received Acute Care from both elective and non-elective procedures or treatment. Predominantly the Intermediate Care Beds have ensured that patients are not occupying Acute Beds for lengthy periods of time when their onward therapy needs can be met within this current service.

As North West London moved to managing their community rehabilitation beds capacity across the system, the beds commissioned by Harrow borough were opened up from patient's with a Harrow GP only, to patient's registered with any North West London GP.

NHS NWL ICB and its partners all recognise the need to evolve this service to provide a wider range of nursing care services to patients.

The ICB is now exploring the opportunity to re-procure this service and is would very much appreciate the views and feedback from possible providers of the services.

North West London Integrated Care Board is therefore undertaking a market engagement exercise via a Request for Information questionnaire (RFI).

This is a process designed to help North West London Integrated Care Board (ICB) form a view of the best way to commission the service; it is not the beginning of a tender exercise. A further tender advertisement will be issued at the appropriate time where required.
