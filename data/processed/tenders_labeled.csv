      The requirement will see a progressive increase in scope of service, resource & supporting infrastructure commensurate with the workforce profile and corresponding site/programme activities. The Occupational Health (OH) provision of Sizewell Health is being undertaken by a different health provider, requiring close and good working relationships to ensure the smooth running of the entire service.
      The health service will be structured around managing the health of the construction worker with a three-tier approach encapsulating the worker, the workplace and wellbeing - Prevention of Ill Health, Fitness to Work and a Treatment Service.

Manchester International Airport Platform Remodelling - Temporary Works Design,"The planned introduction of longer train services to the Airport in response to future demand growth will mean that double stacking arrangements of trains as currently used will no longer be viable. Through the project's Delivery Steering Group, Northern and TransPennine Express have carried out analysis which has identified that additional platform capacity is needed at the airport in order to realise the full benefit of longer train services serving the airport.
      
      The scheme is part of a package of proposed measures in the Manchester area that are being designed/planned to boost capacity and resilience, emanating from the Cross Manchester Capacity and Reliability Improvement Study. Improving the operation of train services in the centre of Manchester and providing further capacity at Manchester Airport station, aligns with the strategic aims of Network Rail, TfGM, TfN and the wider industry.  This project in in Tranche 1 of the Manchester and North West Transformation Programme (MNTP):
       
      A remodelling of the station at Manchester Airport, specifically a platform addition or extension of multiple platforms, or provision of a new turnback facility, will be essential to accommodate the planned implementation of longer rolling stock services.
           
      The redevelopment of these platforms will enable permissive working of two 6x24m (144m) trains, in two of the four platforms at the Airport Station. This will allow for the unaltered retention of all existing TOC services both originating and terminating at the Airport Station under 'double-stacking' conditions.
      
      The scope areas for this package are as follows:
      - Main Compound - Fencing, Cabins, Storage

Oldfield Road - Design and Install Temporary Compound and Scaffold Lighting,"This is an enhancement scheme funded by the DfT and is part of a package of proposed measures in the Manchester area that are planned to boost capacity and resilience, emanating from the Cross Manchester Capacity and Reliability Improvement Study. 
      
      The scheme is for the design and delivery of an East facing turnback, located on the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Line (ELR: MVE1) adjacent to the existing Salford Hope Street (Cemex) sidings between Salford Central Station and the Oldfield Road Bridge.
      
      At Victoria Station, the through platforms also accommodate terminating trains. The extended time to terminate and turnback in the platforms restricts platform availability for through services. The provision of the turnback siding will allow terminating services from the East arriving at Victoria to clear the platform, travel to the turnback siding and await their next turn of duty, clear of the station.
      
      There is the further benefit of an additional stop at Salford Central Station for passengers to disembark for Manchester Spinningfields, a major employment location in the city centre. The turnback would also act as a service recovery measure during times of service perturbation.
      
      The turnback is to consist of two roads, to accommodate trains up to 8 car x 24m in one road and 6 car x 24m in a second road; with access to and from platforms 3-6 at Manchester Victoria via existing connections.  The new east facing turnback shall also be able to operate as a berthing/storage siding, with walking routes to allow train crew to access and egress the railway. The turnback will be fully electrified at 25kV and be fully signalled as a route for planned, rather than simply emergency, usage.","North West,Any region",Kier Transportation,50000,100000,1

An initial Request for Information (RFI) related to this project was issued in March 2023 and the information provided was extremely helpful. More recently a second RFI was issued for further clarification from the market (Notice reference 2024/S 000-040487).

The fixed budget for the Design & Build of the Solar PV Canopy is £1,050,000 excluding VAT.
Supplier minimum contribution for EV Infrastructure is £330,000 excluding VAT.
EV Charging revenue estimate for the proposed 15 year period is  £4.158M excluding VAT.
Total value is £5.208m excluding VAT, £6.25M inclusive of VAT.

The contract value has been calculated by reference to the potential revenue that the Council considers could be collected by the Concessionaire through the provision of the Services for the entire contract duration. However, the value of the Contract is ultimately dependent on the vagaries of the market and the above income figure does not carry any guarantee of value or volume of business over the contract term.

Invitation to Tender for Care at Home Services Wellbeing Support for Adults,"Bury Council is seeking a number of providers to deliver its Care at Home Service.
The service will be split into two lots as follows:

The contract is split into two Lots, Lot 1 Primary Framework Providers (Main and Alternate) and Lot 2 Secondary Framework Providers (backup).

Lot 1 Primary Framework Providers: up to ten main service providers will be appointed; two in each of the defined contractual neighbourhoods (please see map below outlining the areas).

This means that, on their 'week on', main service providers will accept minimum 80% of all referrals; on their 'week off', the main service provider will be expected to accept up to 20 % of referrals. The reason for this is to allow the service provider time to embed the support plan for each person referred. The two main service providers in each neighbourhood should work in partnership to ensure 100% of packages are accepted.

Lot 2 Secondary Framework Providers: up to five backup providers covering the full borough (all 5 zones) accepting packages of care when the Lot 1 providers are unable (must not exceed 600 hours unless in exceptional circumstances agreed by the Commissioner/ Council).

The contract is for an initial period of three-years, with an option to extend for a further 2 x 12-month periods, dependent upon annual performance reviews and at the council's discretion.

Connect to Work Programme,"Buckinghamshire Council is excited to announce an incredible opportunity to partner with us on the Connect to Work programme. This initiative aims to break down barriers to employment and provide sustainable job opportunities for individuals with complex needs. By joining forces with us, you'll not only help transform lives but also contribute to the growth and productivity of our local economy. 
What is Connect to Work? -The Get Britain Working White Paper, released in November 2024, introduced the key supported employment programme, which aims to  help eligible individuals secure sustainable, long-term employment. Currently, it is estimated that there are about 3million economically inactive people in the UK, of whom 1.9million people would like to work, but require support to do so. In 2023, 9,600 Buckinghamshire residents were economically inactive and wished to work but required support to do so. Buckinghamshire Council expects to support 720 individuals (at the peak) at an anticipated cost of up to £2.5million in the peak year, delivered over an initial three-year period, with the opportunity to extend to 5 years. It will help connect local work, health and skills support and help eligible participants to secure sustainable work through a voluntary supported employment model, adhering to Individual Placement & Support (IPS) and Supported Employment Quality Framework (SEQF) frameworks. Through this, the programme will expand the use of the proven five stage Supported Employment model of 'place, train and maintain'. 
 How will it be managed and delivered?- Buckinghamshire Council is the Accountable Body. Working with the Department for Work and Pensions, Buckinghamshire Council will oversee the programme including procuring and managing delivery partner to provide sufficient high-quality support to participants and employers to make the programme a success. Our ambition is to deliver this programme in partnership with one high-quality provider, who are able to meet set targets for supporting economically inactive adults in Buckinghamshire into work. We are looking for delivery partner with considerable and demonstrable experience of providing supported employment programmes which deliver to both individuals with complex barriers, and employers who will provide the sustainable jobs. Partner that succeed in the selection process, must either already deliver IPS and SEQF, have robust training plans or intend to deliver both models in a consortium or subcontracting model which is clearly demonstrated in the application. process.  Further, the successful bidder must show developed relationships with employers within Buckinghamshire (or a commutable distance given the target audience) with the ability to identify employment opportunities and support employers to provide successful, sustainable job outcomes.

PIN Peer Review of Initial Site Evaluations (ISE,"NWS has previously developed an ISE Template [7] that sets out the planned content of an ISE to meet regulatory expectations for an ISE detailed in references [3 and 4]. The ISE Template has provided a focus for dialogue with the EA on the content of ISEs and detailed feedback has previously been provided to the Employer by the Environment Agency [8].


The Employer (NWS) now plans to develop ISE for two Search Areas (referred to in this CTS as Copeland and Theddlethorpe) and plans to submit permit applications in 2028 to undertake intrusive investigations works within these areas. These Search Area-specific ISE will synthesis studies and assessments, e.g. feasibility studies and characterisation plans, that are being produced as part of wider GDF programme delivery. These inputs to the ISE have been termed 'source products'. The Integrated Assurance and Approvals Plan (IAAP) establishes an assurance strategy that envisages the iterative development of the ISE in consultation with the EA. The first iteration involves the development of a 'Trial ISE', which will develop the ISE Template using available 'source products' for one of the Search Areas. Search Area-specific ISE will subsequently be produced and undergo two rounds of development: a 'Draft ISE' and 'Final ISE'.


The objective of the contract is for a Consultant to provide impartial scrutiny of the NWS's approach to developing ISEs, with the intention of building wider stakeholder confidence in the approach being adopted. This scrutiny will also facilitate the identification of risks and opportunities associated with the NWS's approach and will seek to mitigate any cognitive biases that may have also developed.

The Consultant's team should consist of a minimum of two peer reviewers. The peer reviewers should be independent of the Employer's work to develop the ISE and the associated permit applications. Give the novel nature of the ISE and associated permit application, direct experience of the staged regulation guidance and ISE development is therefore not possible.

The peer reviewers should have significant (10 years +) international experience of the development of Environmental Safety Cases for geological disposal facilities and the associated regulatory requirements. The Consultant should describe in their tender how the skills and experience of their team will benefit the peer review process and overall quality of the ISE submissions

-To establish an Approved Provider List of providers who have met and continue to meet the Authority&apos;s minimum selection criteria over the term of the FA.

-To establish a transparent Call-Off and Award Procedure that can be adapted to the individual requirements of each Call-Off contract whereby the Authority can effectively narrow the pool of eligible providers from the Approved Provider List to those most appropriate and capable to be Invited to Tender based on pre-published Categories.

The scope of services is a range of purpose led, place-based, supplementary community services that are uniquely suited to the Voluntary sector and small-to-medium-enterprises (SMEs). The framework aims to enable NHS MSE ICB to develop a process that will support the community and voluntary organisations of any size to have a governance process in place to support with future commissioning and best utilise funding as it is available.

Central Project Register and Progress Tracker,"The MCA has grown rapidly in scale and complexity in the last 7 years.  Processes and tools that were adequate for managing a smaller organisation cannot be easily scaled up to manage the growing volume of activity and number of projects.

There is currently no central list of all projects and activity across the MCA, or consistent recording of project attributes.  Whilst individual business areas keep track, this is done inconsistently across the organisation and relies on heavy use of spreadsheets - compromising accuracy, completeness and timeliness of reporting.  Summary reporting against strategic objectives and business plan deliverables is a very unreliable, cumbersome and manual process.

Project progress is currently monitored through the collation of 'highlight' reports from project managers.  The format for these reports is currently either MS Excel or MS Word.  Whilst the Excel version does provide some structured data for onward reporting it is a manual process to transform the data into a suitable format. The quality and completeness of the reports is inconsistent and there is considerable manual validation and correction required.  The Word version provides mainly unstructured data and so the process for reporting from these is even more resource intensive. In addition, with over 100 projects, the number of highlight reports that are manually requested, checked and then filed is significant.  

Purpose of Procurement

The objective of this work is to ensure that the MCA has a robust and accurate set of key information about all projects in development and delivery.  The data will be in a format that can be maintained and accessed by teams across the regional partnership and that can be used to meet many different reporting requirements.  This will facilitate oversight and assurance of developing proposals and management of the performance of schemes in delivery.  It will enable the MCA to evidence how much it has invested in projects across each strategic priority, how well those projects are performing against plan and what outputs and outcomes they're delivering.

Kent & Medway Appropriate Adult (AA) Service,"The Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent would like to invite suppliers to attend a supplier engagement event in relation to an Appropriate Adult (AA) Service for Kent & Medway.

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) introduced the provision of Appropriate Adults (AA) to safeguard the interests of vulnerable adults and juveniles suspected of a criminal offence. An AA's role is to ensure that vulnerable people are treated fairly, with respect for their rights and entitlements and that they can understand and participate effectively in criminal proceedings related to the investigation and/or their detention. AAs can also reduce the risk of miscarriages of justice because evidence obtained from vulnerable suspects which, by virtue of their vulnerability, could lead to unsafe convictions. 
Under PACE the Police have a statutory requirement to provide an AA when dealing with a suspect who is a juvenile or vulnerable adult, but they cannot provide the AA themselves, as they must be independent from the police.

WCC is looking to develop its next generation, strategic data platform, to underpin its reporting, analytics, AI and personalisation goals. The platform will leverage Snowflake as its core data warehouse, likely supported by a range of other products and services. The programme of work will involve consolidation of a range of existing data platforms through migration activities, as well as identifying and processing new datasets to fuel new data products. 
 
The programme will likely involve several phases. In first instance, the contract will focus on Phase One, covering delivery items related to the Data hub and Data deliverables. Future phases, that are in scope, will be subject to variations throughout the contract term, as and when required as the programme progresses and subject to budget approval.  
 
Phase 1
The initial phase will be to design the new data warehouse environment, then migrate and refactor the existing corporate data warehouse. It will involve discovery and analysis around the data sets, privacy considerations, etc. of the data held in the existing Microsoft SQL Server environment. These datasets and their data pipelines will need to be migrated onto the Snowflake environment. Downstream dependencies such as Power BI dashboards will need to be repointed and if necessary, redesigned. Importantly, this will require extensive refactoring. For example, ingestion may move from SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to Azure Data Factory (ADF) and the overall architectural pattern will move from ETL to ELT. The migration is therefore not a ""lift and shift"" migration. However, the scope will be limited to datasets currently processed into the existing CDW.

It should be noted that the advertised estimated budget of up to £3.87million represents the full potential project and is subject to further budgetary approval. The initial Phase One budget is up to £850,000.00. Further phases and additional expenditure will be confirmed as the programme progresses and are discretionary,  subject to both budgetary approval and the requirements of the council, therefore not guaranteed to the supplier.",London,Westminster City Council,850000,3870000,1

Cambridge City Council - Cycle Parking Improvements at Queen Anne Terrace Car Park,"Cambridge City Council (CCC) is enhancing the public cycle parking at the Queen Anne Terrace (QAT) multi-story car park on Gonville Place in central Cambridge. The cycle parking at QAT addresses a strong local need due to its proximity to key facilities, including businesses, leisure and shopping areas, hospitality venues, green open spaces, and other amenities. Recreational and sports facilities are also available on site.
The proposed improvements include additional cycle parking spaces and enhancements to safety, security, and accessibility. There are two cycle parking areas at QAT: one inside the car park building and the other outside, which is not covered. Both are at street level. There is a demand for safe, secure, and accessible short-term and long-term cycle parking.
In the undercover cycle parking area, CCC plans to remove all existing cycle stands and ground anchors, adjust fence lines, and screed the floor before installing new cycle stands in a 'toast-rack' setup (consisting of two or more cycle stands securely attached to horizontal steel sections), cargo cycle parking bays with new ground anchors, and signage. An access-controlled area is also proposed, which will require a swing gate fitted with mag locks.
For the external cycle parking area, CCC proposes to remove all existing vegetation, including a semi-mature tree, and all existing cycle stands and concrete hardstanding. The area will then be excavated to install an engineered tree pit with a hardstanding area above, and new root-fixed cycle stands (each stand leg embedded into a concrete foundation).
New trees will be planted after the works are complete.

"To Provide Non-acute intermediate care beds (step-up, step-down & rehabilitation) in Harrow for North West London Integrated Care Board - Request for Information","North West London Integrated Care Board (ICB) seeks the views of Providers in commissioning for the provision of local community beds (step-up, step-down rehabilitation) for a wide range of conditions which are located in acute, intermediate care and community facilities. The aim of the service is to provide medical, nursing, and therapeutic inpatient rehabilitation for patients that are registered with a North West London GP.

The objective is to provide multidisciplinary assessments of patients from the local Trust and discharge patients to the most appropriate setting via the trusted assessor team based at Northwick Park Hospital.

In 2017, NHS Harrow borough originally developed a new integrated care pathway for adults and frail elderly people to avoid hospital admissions, support early discharge and promote effective rehabilitation and reablement, wherever possible in a community setting. The main acute hospital, London North West University Hospital Trust, was consistently subject to increasing demands for rehabilitation and acute treatment beds.

Since its inception the Intermediate Care Beds has provided a route for patients who have received Acute Care from both elective and non-elective procedures or treatment. Predominantly the Intermediate Care Beds have ensured that patients are not occupying Acute Beds for lengthy periods of time when their onward therapy needs can be met within this current service.

As North West London moved to managing their community rehabilitation beds capacity across the system, the beds commissioned by Harrow borough were opened up from patient's with a Harrow GP only, to patient's registered with any North West London GP.

NHS NWL ICB and its partners all recognise the need to evolve this service to provide a wider range of nursing care services to patients.

The ICB is now exploring the opportunity to re-procure this service and is would very much appreciate the views and feedback from possible providers of the services.

North West London Integrated Care Board is therefore undertaking a market engagement exercise via a Request for Information questionnaire (RFI).

This is a process designed to help North West London Integrated Care Board (ICB) form a view of the best way to commission the service; it is not the beginning of a tender exercise. A further tender advertisement will be issued at the appropriate time where required.

To access the documents and participate, please register and apply via Atamis e-sourcing portal:
